Today I learned a bit more on how `height:auto` works. Let's say you have a box that has
implicit `height` & `width` set to `250px`. Inside this box you place 1px by 1px image.
You give image `height: auto`. What is happening? This image is taking whole 250px height!

<BlogPostImage src="2020-12-02-1" alt="1x1 px box" />

But you do the same with image 250px by 1px (250px width by 1px height) - image is taking only 1px height.

<BlogPostImage src="2020-12-02-250" alt="250x250px box" />

So if you want your image to take only 1px with `height:auto` make sure that such image has full width
of parent.

You can see example in this [codepen](https://codepen.io/krzysztofzuraw/pen/oNzXEGY).
