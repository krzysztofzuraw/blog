I have learned how to correctly link a local npm dependency when using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Here is the process:

1. Execute `pnpm install ./your-library.tgz`.
2. Include the following code in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "your-library": "file:./your-library.version.tgz"
    }
  }
}
```

Your dependency should now be properly linked!
