**Hello! Spring has come so I decided that I need to changes- so I
change my blog engine to** [pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/).

This blog will be about small compassion between three static site
generators and why I choose pelican.

What are static site generators?

They are engines that generates web sites using only static
content. So there is no need for any backend or database at all. Most of
static site generators allow writing posts in markdown or rst formats.

## Nikola

When I started writing this blog I used a
[Nikola](https://getnikola.com/). What is it? It python powered static
site generator. I has a lot of features 'out of the box':

1.  Incremental builds. That means only modified content is regenerated
    to html.
2.  Support for comments. All you need to do is to set up option.
3.  Support for IPython Notebooks.
4.  Automatic deployment to Github pages.
5.  Extensions to RST format.

I really enjoyed working with Nikola, but I changed it to another engine
because I was overwhelmed by a lot of options that I don't need. Also
community is not huge but it is very helpful.

## Jekyll

Then I moved to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This is ruby static
site generator. What I like about jekyll is support for [github
pages](https://pages.github.com/). Also is the most popular static site
generator with a lot of community and themes. What I don't like is it
doesn't have support for tags out of the box. I know that it can be done
by some ruby code, but I like this feature to be build in. Moreover
while you 'upload' your entire catalog with jekyll configuration your
custom plugins don't work. You have to stick to these provided in
[github](https://pages.github.com/versions/).

## Pelican

So I decided to move to [pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/). What I
like so far is that I have some more freedom to customize engine than in
nikola and I have out of the box support for tags. But there is thing:
pelican only generates content. So you have to serve it somehow. To do
this I run simple python server. I don't like this approach- I want it
to be automatic. I will write next blog post about how to do this. Stay
tuned!
