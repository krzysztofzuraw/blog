Today I learned about `:placeholder-shown` selector in CSS.
What is doing? It is selecting those inputs - if you are gonna use it as `input:placeholder-shown`
which currently has a placeholder. It works on all browsers except IE11. When it can be useful?

For styling input with float label + placeholder. See the example below (works on chrome/safari) -
see line 55 inside this [codepen](https://codepen.io/team/css-tricks/pen/XVBLRM)
