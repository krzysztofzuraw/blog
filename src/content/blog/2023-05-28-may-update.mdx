I’m back with monthly updates - I recently figured out that I haven’t posted an update from [October 2020](https://krzysztofzuraw.com/blog/2022/october-2022-update/). This was a hectic month both at work and in private life. I’m at the end of the process of figuring out what interior design should I have in my new house. It is also time for car shopping - I’m moving outside the city so I have to commute by car.

## Reading

- [Making Money by Terry Pratchett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116296.Making_Money). I’m in the middle of small Pratchett series about technical evolution and this one is all about money and banks. I have to say I laughed a lot during reading. 8/10.

## Watching

- [John Wick 4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366206/). I think this is a nice ending to the whole series. Sometimes scenes were a bit too long and some characters pop in and out quickly. All in all - 7/10.
- [Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2906216/). I don’t have much hope for this one but I was pretty surprised. I like it. The story and actors were good. I spend a couple of nice hours in front of the cinema screen. 8/10.
- [Vox machina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11247158/). I got this one as a recommendation from a friend after I watched Dungeons & Dragons. The whole series was awesome and I felt that I know what will happen but many times I was shocked at how they moved the story. Recommend - 9/10.
