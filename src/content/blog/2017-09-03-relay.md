**Today I want to talk a little bit more about my next step in
developing a GraphQL application. This step is connected with moving
backend so it understands Relay.**

## What exactly is Realy

As documentation of [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) suggests
it's framework for working with external data in React. What does it
mean? It allows a developer to declare what data he or she needs on
frontend and relay will take care how to fetch it and use it in React
code.

## How to setup Relay in Django

In 2 first blog post of this series, I created GraphQL from Django using
`DjangoObjectType`. Right now if I want to
use my application with Relay I have to move to the more generic
solution and implements nodes that can be understood by Relay:

```python
class Film(graphene.ObjectType):

    class Meta:
        interfaces = (relay.Node, )

    title = graphene.String()
    actors = graphene.List(Actor, description='List of actors that play in the film')
    air_date = graphene_datetime.DateTime()
    rating = graphene.Int()

    @classmethod
    def create_from_data(cls, data, id_):
        return cls(
            id=id_,
            title=data['title'],
            air_date=arrow.get(data['air_date']).date(),
            rating=data['rating'],
        )


    @classmethod
    def get_node(cls, id, context, info):
        response = requests.get(FILMS_ENDPOINT.format(id=id))
        data = response.json()
        return Film.create_from_data(data, id)

    def resolve_actors(self, args, context, info):
        response = requests.get(FILMS_ENDPOINT.format(id=self.id))
        data = response.json()
        return [relay.Node.get_node_from_global_id(
            to_global_id('Actor', actor_id),
            context,
            info
        ) for actor_id in data['actors']]
```

As you can see I declare `realy.Node` in `Meta`. Then I specified which
fields should `Film` need. I also added `get_node` method for getting
data via one instance and `resolve_actors` to get related data from
actors schema. I added this to my `Query`:

```python
class Query(graphene.AbstractType):
    film = graphene.relay.Node.Field(Film)
    films = graphene.List(Film)

    def resolve_films(self, args, context, info):
        response = requests.get(ALL_FILMS_ENDPOINT)
        data = response.json()
        return [Film.create_from_data(film, film['id']) for film in data]
```

Now I can query for both all films:

```javascript
{
  films {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

to get:

```javascript
{
    "data": {
        "films": [
        {
            "id": "RmlsbTox",
            "title": "Pulp Fiction"
        },
        {
            "id": "RmlsbToy",
            "title": "Django"
        },
        {
            "id": "RmlsbToz",
            "title": "Inglourious Basterds"
        },
        {
            "id": "RmlsbTo0",
            "title": "The Hateful Eight"
        },
        ]
    }
}
```

as you can see ids are encoded using base64 as relay is using such
format in its queries. I wrote similar code for actor model. Thanks to
that I can query for example first one:

```javascript
{
    actor(id:"QWN0b3I6MQ==") {
        firstName
        lastName
    }
}
```

and get result:

```javascript
{
    "data": {
        "actor": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Travolta"
        }
    }
}
```

The last thing I want to cover are mutations - they allow to create a
new data using GraphQL. How to implement one:

```python
class CreateFilm(relay.ClientIDMutation):

    class Input:
        title = graphene.String(required=True)
        actors = graphene.List(ActorInput)
        air_date = graphene_datetime.DateTime(required=True)
        rating = graphene.Int(required=True)

    film = graphene.Field(Film)

    @classmethod
    def mutate_and_get_payload(cls, args, context, info):
        actors_ids = [from_global_id(actor['actor_id'])[1] for actor in args['actors']]
        data_to_sent = {
            'title': args['title'],
            'actors': actors_ids,
            'air_date': arrow.get(args['air_date']).date(),
            'rating': args['rating'],
        }
        response = requests.post(ALL_FILMS_ENDPOINT, data=data_to_sent)
        data_from_server = response.json()
        film = Film.create_from_data(data_from_server, data_from_server['id'])
        return CreateFilm(film=film)


class Mutation(graphene.AbstractType):
    create_film = CreateFilm.Field()
```

Main logic sits in `mutate_and_get_payload` where I get database ids
from ones sent by Relay. I also hit the Django API to get all actors and
create a film entry. My mutation can look like this:

```javascript
mutation createNewFilm {
    createFilm(input: {title: "New title", actors: [{actorId: "QWN0b3I6MQ=="}], airpubDate: "2017-01-01", rating: 3}) {
            film {
            id
            title
            rating
            airDate
            actors {
                firstName
                lastName
            }
        }
    }
}
```

and I get back:

```javascript
{
    "data": {
        "createFilm": {
            "film": {
                "id": "RmlsbTo0OQ==",
                "title": "New title",
                "rating": 3,
                "airDate": "2017-01-01",
                "actors": [
                    {
                        "firstName": "John",
                        "lastName": "Travolta"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That's all for today! I have my backend ready to work in Relay! Please

post - all are welcome and take care!
