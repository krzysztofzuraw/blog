I recently was setting up workflow for developing email templates and I need a way to copy files from `src` directory into `dist` build folder. It turns out that you can use for this [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/). Script below is using [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) library to watch for all `.txt` files under source directory and copy them from to build output directory. In addition to that it flattens the path - so if file is under `src/plaintext/plaintext.txt` the path in output will be `dist/plaintext.txt`.

```js
import { copyFileSync, existsSync, mkdirSync } from "fs";
import glob from "glob";
import { basename, join } from "path";

const directory = "dist";

if (!existsSync(directory)) {
  mkdirSync(directory);
}

glob("src/**/*.txt", (err, files) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error", err);
  }

  files.forEach((file) => {
    copyFileSync(file, join(directory, basename(file)));
  });
});
```

How to run this script? I' using `nodemon copy-plaintext.mjs --ext txt --watch src` command in my `package.json`. It looks for all files with `txt` extension under `src` folder - if they change I'm running `copy-plaintext.mjs`.
