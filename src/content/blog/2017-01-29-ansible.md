**As I recently have opportunity of having a workshop about ansible in
my work and I decided to write a blog post on how to provision django
application using this tool.**

## What is ansible and how's is different from puppet

Ansible is a tool that helps automate boring tasks. These tasks are
connected with setting up Linux machines, installing proper software on
them and moving code from repositories to machines. Ansible has a
different way of accomplishing these tasks than puppet. It is using push
_system_ - in short ansible connects to your machine via ssh and push
changes. No need for masters and agents etc. Puppet, on the other hand,
is using pull _system_ which allows every machine to pull changes from
master. Ansible is using the same principles as puppet so you declare
how should host look like after running ansible.

## Provisioning django application using ansible

I will be provisioning
[geodjango-leaflet](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/geodjango-leaflet).
I assume that you know basic concepts of ansible like play, playbook or
role. This is how a structure of my ansible repo looks like:

```bash
.
├── ansible.cfg
├── inventory
│   └── vagrant
│       └── hosts.ini
├── playbooks
│   ├── roles -> ../roles/
│   └── vagrant.yaml
├── roles
│   ├── db
│   │   └── tasks
│   │       └── main.yml
│   ├── geodjango
│   │   ├── handlers
│   │   │   └── main.yml
│   │   ├── tasks
│   │   │   └── main.yml
│   │   └── templates
│   │       ├── nginx.conf.j2
│   │       └── supervisord.conf.j2
│   ├── redis
│   │   └── tasks
│   │       └── main.yml
│   └── roles -> roles
└── Vagrantfile
```

Let's start from the bottom - Vagrantfile. I will be using vagrant as a
playground. Configuration file a.k.a vagrantfile looks as follows:

```ruby
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"

Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
config.vm.box = "trusty64"
config.vm.box_url = "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box"
config.ssh.insert_key = false

config.vm.hostname = "vagrant-ansible"
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
 ansible.playbook = "playbooks/vagrant.yaml"
 ansible.inventory_path = "inventory/vagrant/hosts.ini"
 ansible.sudo = true
 ansible.verbose = "v"
 ansible.limit = "all"
end

end
```

I setup basic `private_network` with ip of a vagrant box. In
`config.vm.provision` I specified playbook which should be run in
vagrant and inventory where the configuration of my hosts lay. This
inventory presents itself below:

```ini
vagrant-ansible ansible_ssh_host=192.168.33.10 ansible_ssh_port=22
```

My ansible playbook don't have tasks inside it but I delegate it to
roles:

```yaml
---
- hosts: vagrant-ansible
  become: yes

  roles:
    - db
    - geodjango
    - redis
```

Let's start with the first role: `db`. In folder with this role, I have
tasks folder with `main.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: ensure apt cache is up to date
  apt: update_cache=yes

- name: ensure packages are installed
  apt:
    name: "{{item}}"
  with_items:
    - postgresql
    - libpq-dev
    - python-psycopg2
    - postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.1
    - python3-dev
    - python-dev

- name: ensure database is created
  become_user: postgres
  postgresql_db:
    name: geodjango

- name: ensure user has access to database
  become_user: postgres
  postgresql_user:
    db: geodjango
    name: geodjango
    password: geodjango
    priv: ALL

- name: enable postgis for database
  become_user: postgres
  postgresql_ext:
    name: postgis
    db: geodjango
```

In this task, I run `apt-get update` at the top then I install a couple
of packages so I can setup Postgres. Right below that I create db, grant
user access to that db and create PostGIS extension. As this role
completes ansible will execute `geodjango` role:

```yaml
---
- name: ensure packages are installed
  apt:
    name: "{{item}}"
  with_items:
    - binutils
    - libproj-dev
    - gdal-bin
    - git
    - python-virtualenv
    - build-essential
    - postgresql-server-dev-all
    - supervisor
    - nginx

- name: ensure git repo is present
  git:
    repo: https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/geodjango-leaflet.git
    dest: /opt/geodjango

- name: create virtualenv
  command: virtualenv /opt/venv -p python3.4 creates="/opt/venv"

- name: install requirements
  pip:
    requirements: /opt/geodjango/requirements.txt
    executable: /opt/venv/bin/pip

- name: migrate django application
  django_manage:
    command: migrate
    virtualenv: /opt/venv
    app_path: /opt/geodjango

- name: load django initial data
  django_manage:
    command: load_inital_voivodeships
    virtualenv: /opt/venv
    app_path: /opt/geodjango

- name: collect static files
  django_manage:
    command: collectstatic
    virtualenv: /opt/venv
    app_path: /opt/geodjango

- name: ensure config dir for supervisor extists
  file:
    slug: /etc/supervisor/conf.d
    state: directory

- name: ensure supervisor config is present
  template:
    src: templates/supervisord.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/supervisor/conf.d/geodjango.conf
  notify: reread supervisor

- name: remove default nginx configuration
  file:
    name: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    state: absent

- name: ensure nginx config is present
  template:
    src: templates/nginx.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/geodjango.conf
  notify: restart nginx
```

This code above is self-explanatory but I will write closely about task
called `create virtualenv`. Normally you can write this and next one
task in one like:

```yaml
pip:
  requirements: /opt/geodjango/requirements.txt
  virtualenv: /opt/venv
```

And if this virtualenv is not present it will be created. But there is a
bug in ansible that is causing these requirements to be installed in
system wide python, not virtualenv one. Reference is
[here](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/issues/5458). I
use fix provided by one of the guys in this issue discussion - I break
this task into two separate: one for creating virtualenv and second one
for installing requirements.

What is different in this task is that I'm also using templates for
supervisor and Nginx. They have `j2` ending as ansible is using jinja2
template system. During the ansible run, they will be copied to given
`dest`. At the end of tasks with templates I have `notify` keyword which
tells ansible to look for handlers folder with tasks for restarting
services. In my case they look as follows:

```yaml
---
- name: reread supervisor
  supervisorctl:
    name: geodjango_leaflet
    state: present

- name: restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
```

The last role is redis. This code installs redis-server and starts it:

```yaml
---
- name: ensure redis packages are installed
  apt:
    name: "{{item}}"
  with_items:
    - redis-server

- name: ensure redis is started
  become: true
  service:
    name: redis-server
    state: started
    enabled: yes
```

## My thoughts and feelings about ansible

I have to say I'm really impressed on how simple is to write ansible
tasks. With puppet, I have this problem that I need to look for modules
in puppet forge or write my own. Here everything is included. You want
to use django commands -use `django_manage`, need to reread supervisor
config use `present` in `supervisorctl` task. Really simple and fun to
work with. I can quickly get a job done and move to another stuff.

Yet, I don't know how ansible will behave when it comes to provisioning
a large amount of machines. Here I have only one host and it's going
smoothly, but for sure when I will have a need for provisioning my
private machines I will choose ansible.

That's all for this week blog post! Feel free to comment - I really
appreciate that.
