Today I learned about `<base />` tag. It is really useful in a situation where you need to tell
the browser what is the base for relative links. Why you need that?
Imagine that you have a script that is located on CDN: `https://cdn/application/index.html` and from
inside index.html you have a JS tag that points to `index.js`.

If you want implicitly tell browser to look for `index.js` inside `application/*` folder not `https://cdn`
you can drop [base](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) tag:

```html
<base ref="https://cdn/application/" />
```

It is telling the browser to base all relative links on `https://cdn/application/`.
Notice trailing slash at the end - this is important to `base` to work.

You have base tag ready - now it is time to add `script` tag:

```html
<script src="app.js" />
```

Notice that it donâ€™t have `./` or `/` at the beginning `src` parameter - it is relative link.

Now the browser will resolve `app.js` to `https://cdn/application/app.js`. You can read more on MDN
[base](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) documentation page.

If you need to set it up using [html-webpack](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/) plugin:

1. add `base` param to html-webpack options:

```js
{
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: paths.indexHTML, // path to your index.html if you are using it
      base: `https://cdn/application/`,
    }),
  ];
}
```

2. make sure that you don't have `publicPath` set in the webpack config.
3. It is causing the output to be `/app.js` (or whatever you set your public path) instead of having `app.js`

## Summary

In this post, I wrote about [base](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base)
an HTML tag that can be used to hint browser what is the base URL for relative links inside a document.
