It turns out you can hide all this SEO spam that pops up while searching Google using uBlock filters. There are at least two ways of doing that:

1. Using site like [Let's Block It!](https://letsblock.it/) to generate custom uBlock rule.
2. Using already made uBlock rule list - [quenhus/uBlock-Origin-dev-filter](https://github.com/quenhus/uBlock-Origin-dev-filter). For this I recommend using this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quenhus/uBlock-Origin-dev-filter/main/dist/google/all.txt) to filter as one on GitHub does not work.
