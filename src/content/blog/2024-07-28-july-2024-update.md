Long time no see - I recently checked and it seems like the last blog post I wrote was about one year ago. I tried to come back to more regular writing schedule but having house is not easy task so I postponed it a couple of times and here we are - almost one year later.

**What changed in this one year?**

As I mentioned I bought a house in suburbs on Wroc≈Çaw so almost all this year was connected with preparing it for living. It still amazes me how hard is to find good specialist for almost every stage of home renovating / preparing for use. Fortunately I managed to almost complete all of required work to have comfortable living (I wanted to avoid having renovation going on for next 10 years). That is why I think I can go back to writing more. At work I'm currently mainly focused on backend part of Next.js applications - it is quite fun to works with server less environment so I think I will write more about this year.

Let's get going and see you around üëãüèª
