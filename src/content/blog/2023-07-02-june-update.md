June went fast - mostly because I'm waiting for the home finish in September.

# Reading

- [Wool](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus). I picked this one based on Apple TV+ Series. It is something different than a TV show. It has a different vibe - more of Fallout than big brother watches. Price on Amazon is also interesting - 2$ for the first book and 11$ for the second.
- [Rhythm of War part 1](https://www.amazon.com/RHYTHM-OF-WAR-PART-ONE/dp/0575093412). I like Sanderson's books - they remind me of Tolkien's big word with its history.

# Watching

- [Silo season 1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/). Nice TV show. I liked the atmosphere of big brother watches. It's funny that the first season ended in about 40% of the first book.
- [Guardians of the Galaxy 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6791350). I feared that part of the franchise may be boring like other recent Marvel movies but I was positively surprised.
- [Black Mirror season 6](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/). I don't understand this season. It is not about the dangers of technology but more about media. The weakest season of all.
