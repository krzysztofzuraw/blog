This is the second post of my series about things that i found on the internet this week.

# Coding

- [Baymard Institute](https://baymard.com/) - a lot of great knowledge about UX/UI based on research.
  I started reading and I'm finding more and more useful info there.
- [CSS Grid course](cssgrid.io/) by Wes Bos. Awesome content. I have a blog post about it coming but
  what I really like is how Wes is giving me incentive to do some more work with CSS grid.

# Other

- [Text file time blocking](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/03/16/text-file-time-blocking/) - nice
  write up about time blocking in text file. After this post I decided to try it - so far (2 days) it
  is nice. Let's see how it gonna fly.

- [Plain text project](https://plaintextproject.online/) - as we are on plain text field. Really nice
  blog about all things plain text.
