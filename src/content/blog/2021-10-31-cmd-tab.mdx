I recently started using 2 monitors on my Mac. Everything works fine except one tiny detail - cmd + tab switching between applications. I know that I can specify on which monitor should application switcher appear by showing dock on this monitor. Problem is that is no possible to do if I have monitor to the right and dock to the right as well. Instead I found solution to show application switcher on both monitors from [superuser.com](https://superuser.com/questions/670252/cmdtab-app-switcher-is-on-the-wrong-monitor):

```shell
defaults write com.apple.Dock appswitcher-all-displays -bool true
killall Dock
```

You may need to restart your computer.
