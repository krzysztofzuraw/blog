I recently decided to remove a few no so frequently used applications. One of them was [Typinator](https://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/).
It is a text expander - one of many. While I was researching if I can remove it and consolidate my snippets
I stumbled upon a feature in one of the most used apps by me - [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). There are two messages if
you are looking into Alfred text expanding capabilities - you can do it - yay ðŸŽ‰ and it wont be so simple.

There are two types of text expanding in Alfred world:

1. Simple - like expanding telephone number or date with cursor
2. Complex - with multiple variables & selecting from a list of possible options.

I want to cover here the second one. To have complex text expanding you need to create snippet workflow.
As a demo I've created [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) snippet workflow that ask me a couple of questions
and pastes nicely formatted string into GitHub comment box. Workflow can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/alfred-conventional-comments).

How it is working? At the beginning it ask me about `label` => which I can select from list; then I
type `title` of my comment. Right after that workflow is pasting string:

```markdown
**label**: title
{cursor_postion}
```

into currently focused input field.

## Summary

If you want to have text expander like capabilities in Alfred - it is doable via snippet workflow. You
can start by looking into my [conventional comments](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/alfred-conventional-comments) one.
