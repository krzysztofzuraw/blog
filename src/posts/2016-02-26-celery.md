title: Django + Celery & Rabbit

**Hello, today post is first one in series about Celery in Django
application and how to use it.**

What you gain after reading such series?

How to integrate celery + rabbitmq in basic Django application.

So what will be our basic application?

It is planned to be web service where you can upload mp3 file and then
have them transcoded into ogg, wav and ac3 files.

Recently I started reading an excellent book called [Two Scoops of
Django: Best Practices for Django
1.8](http://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/0981467342).
The book is about what to do and what not to do for your Django project.
I feel some opportunity to try advice from the book in real project. I
will start from project layout: normally you have something like this:

```bash
$ tree trancoder

trancoder
├── audiotranscoder
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── migrations
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
└── trancoder
    ├── manage.py
    └── trancoder
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── settings.py
        ├── urls.py
        └── wsgi.py
```

But in the book authors suggest that it can be changed to something like
this:

```bash
$ tree transcoder

transcoder
├── README.rst
├── requirements.txt
└── transcoder
    ├── audio_transcoder
    │   ├── admin.py
    │   ├── apps.py
    │   ├── forms.py
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── migrations
    │   │   ├── 0001_initial.py
    │   │   └── __init__.py
    │   ├── models.py
    │   ├── tests.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── views.py
    ├── config
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    ├── manage.py
    ├── media
    └── templates
        ├── base.html
        ├── home.html
        └── upload.html
```

After working some time with this layout I have to say that it's very
responsive and good structured in my opinion. But there is need for
changes in 2 files for Django to be able recognizing where to look up
for settings and WSGI modules:

`manage.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "config.settings")

    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)
```

`settings.py`:

```python
# rest of settings file
ROOT_URLCONF = 'config.urls'

WSGI_APPLICATION = 'config.wsgi.application'

MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
```

The transcoder need file to transcode so I created a model, form and
view for mp3 file.

`audio_transcoder/models.py`:

```python
import uuid

from django.db import models


def unique_file_path(instance, filename):
    new_file_name = uuid.uuid4()
    return str(new_file_name)

class AudioFile(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    mp3_file = models.FileField(upload_to=unique_file_path)
    ogg_file = models.FileField(blank=True, upload_to=unique_file_path)
    wav_file = models.FileField(blank=True, upload_to=unique_file_path)
    ac3_file = models.FileField(blank=True, upload_to=unique_file_path)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

To avoid filename duplication of uploaded files I changed their names to
be unique. the `upload_to` argument takes function `unique_file_path`
which will generate unique name. This function has to take 2 arguments:
`instance` and `filename`.

`audio_transcoder/forms.py`:

```python
from django.forms import ModelForm
from .models import AudioFile


class AudioFileFrom(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = AudioFile
        fields = ['name', 'mp3_file']
```

Here I have used `ModelForm` which is the easiest way to generate the
form for given model.

`audio_transcoder/views.py`:

```python
from django.views.generic.edit import FormView
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse

from .forms import AudioFileFrom
from .models import AudioFile


class UploadAudioFileView(FormView):
    template_name = 'upload.html'
    form_class = AudioFileFrom


    def form_valid(self, form):
        audio_file = AudioFile(
            name=self.get_form_kwargs().get('data')['name'],
            mp3_file=self.get_form_kwargs().get('files')['mp3_file']
        )
        audio_file.save()

        return HttpResponseRedirect(self.get_success_url())

    def get_success_url(self):
        return reverse('home')
```

And in `UploadAudioFileView` in form validation I took `name` and
`mp3_file` from form submitted by user and save then in corresponding
model. I have hard time figuring out where to put saving model. At first
I wanted to work as generic CBV so no `form_valid` I pass
additional argument to class: `success_url` but it didn't save
`audioFile`. Also moving `form_valid` to `AudioFileFrom` didn't help.
After some more research I found this [GoDjango
tutorial](https://godjango.com/35-upload-files/). If you have better way
to do this please let me know!

The code that I have made so far is available on
[github](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/blog-celery-rabbit).

In my application transcoding will be performed by ffmpeg. Why is that?

First of all, it's free & open source. So I don't have to pay to use it
and I like using the open source tools. Second thing is that ffmpeg is
more than enough for my task. It has a lot of features including
recording, streaming and transcoding both video and audio.

So how to use it? For this project, the ffmpeg needs to be compiled with
libmp3lame for mp3 files encoding, libvorbis for ogg format and enabled
non-free for ac3. There is
[guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu#ffmpeg) on
ffmpeg site how to compile ffmpeg build. Also, make sure that you have
cookies and tea with you while installation can take even 30 minutes.

After everything is setup all you need to do is:

```bash
$ ffmpeg -i mp3_file.mp3 wav_file.wav
$ ffmpeg -i mp3_file.mp3 ogg_file.ogg
$ ffmpeg -i mp3_file.mp3 ac3_file.ac3
```

The code above will transcode mp3 files into provided format. In my
application one celery task will be called with subprocess, then another
celery task will save the output of the first task to django model.

First: why we need Celery? Imagine that user upload mp3 file to the
application and then in form validation the file is transcoded to other
formats. The problem is that user will have to wait for the end of a
task. So user sends a request. Then he waits for ffmpeg to transcode
uploaded file to different format and then sends the response back. At
first glance, it may look correct. But imagine that there are big files
to transcode or there is a lot of formats to transcode. The user will
have to wait a lot of time. To avoid this I will use celery task with
rabbitmq broker to provide transcoding in the background.

So what is exactly celery? From the
[docs](http://www.celeryproject.org/):

> Celery is a simple, flexible and reliable distributed system to
> process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the
> tools required to maintain such a system.

What does it mean? It is task manager that handle messages (tasks) in
whenever form you like. Task is a function that could calculate
something or handle some logic or maybe transcode files. But celery
without message broker is useless. Celery support a lot of message
brokers, but RabbitMq is supported out of the box so I will use this
service. You may ask what is RabbitMq? It is broker- translates a
message from the sender (django application) to reciever (celery).

So go to code:

First install rabbitmq with plugin that displays its status:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
$ sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
$ sudo rabbitmqctl stop
$ sudo invoke-rc.d rabbitmq-server start
```

Add admin user to rabbitmq-server:

```bash
$ sudo rabbitmqctl add_user admin admin
$ sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags admin administrator
$ sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / admin ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

Right now you can go to `localhost:15672` to see:

{% img "2016-03-12-rabbit", "Rabbit mq panel", "Rabbit mq panel" %}

Now it's time to get celery working. First I will create new folder
called `taskapp` where I will be putting my celery configuration:

```bash
├── audio_transcoder
├── taskapp
│   ├── celery.py
│   ├── __init__.py 
│   └── tasks.py
│ # some other files ...
```

In `celery.py` are configs:

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import

from celery import Celery

app = Celery('transcoder',
             broker='amqp://admin:admin@localhost//',
             include=['taskapp.tasks'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.start()
```

The first line is for backward compatibility with python2. In `app`
configuration I specify: name of application- `transcoder`, url where
broker will be listening with
credentials-`broker='amqp://admin:admin@localhost//'` and files
containing tasks-`include=['taskapp.tasks']`.

Then in `tasks.py` I added task itself:

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import
import os
import os.path
import subprocess

from taskapp.celery import app
from audio_transcoder.models import AudioFile
import config.settings as settings

@app.task
def transcode_mp3(mp3_id):
    audio_file = AudioFile.objects.get(id=mp3_id)
    input_file_path = audio_file.mp3_file.path
    filename = os.path.basename(input_file_path)

    ogg_output_file_name = os.path.join('transcoded', '{}.ogg'.format(filename))
    ogg_output_file_path = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, ogg_output_file_name)

    ac3_output_file_name = os.path.join('transcoded', '{}.ac3'.format(filename))
    ac3_output_file_path = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, ac3_output_file_name)

    wav_output_file_name = os.path.join('transcoded', '{}.wav'.format(filename))
    wav_output_file_path = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, wav_output_file_name)

    if not os.path.isdir(os.path.dirname(ogg_output_file_path)):
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(ogg_output_file_path))

    subprocess.call([
            settings.FFMPEG_PATH,
            '-i',
            input_file_path,
            ogg_output_file_path,
            ac3_output_file_path,
            wav_output_file_path
        ]
    )

    audio_file.ogg_file = ogg_output_file_name
    audio_file.ac3_file = ac3_output_file_name
    audio_file.wav_file = wav_output_file_name
    audio_file.save()
```

What I got there? Let's start with `transcode_mp3` function. It has
`@app.task` decorator to indicate for celery that it is its task. The
argument is `mp3_id`. After getting the id of newly uploaded file this
task gets `audio_file` model from the database and retrieve path to the
uploaded mp3 file. Then it generated file names and paths for every
format: ogg, wav and ac3. Right after it checks whenever folder
`transcoded` under `media` is present. Calling `subprocess` is
the same as calling
`ffmpeg -i mp3_file.mp3 ogg_file.ogg ac3_file.ac3 wav_file.wav`. At the
end task saves the paths to outputs to database.

The tasks itself is called in views:

```python
from taskapp.tasks import transcode_mp3

class UploadAudioFileView(FormView):
    # ...
    def form_valid(self, form):
    # ...
    audio_file.save()
    transcode_mp3.delay(audio_file.id)
    # ...
```

Everything works as expected and I added redirection to detail view of
audio file after successful upload. The problem is that transcode is not
so fast as is redirection.

This and other bugs and small improvements will be fixed and added in
last post of this series in next week. Thanks for reading! I really
appreciate your feedback so please comment or write email. The code is
available on this github
[repo](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/blog-celery-rabbit).

## Audio File detail view

The problem was after successful upload django redirect to detail view
of uploaded file. And in HTML template of this view, it expects that
`ac3_file` will be there but FFmpeg still is transcoding it. So I came up
with solution:

1.First, I added new field to `AudioFile` model called `was_processed`
to indicate whenever file has been processed:

```python
class AudioFile(models.Model):
    # ....
    was_processed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

By default, this field has value `False`.

2.Then in my task I added
[signal](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/signals.html)
handler that ran after every task:

```python
from celery.signals import task_postrun

@task_postrun.connect
def task_executed_handler(sender=None, body=None, **kwargs):
    audio_file = AudioFile.objects.get(id=kwargs['args'][0])
    audio_file.was_processed = True
    audio_file.save()
```

In this handler id of `AudioFile` object is taken from `kwargs`. After
retrieving certain file from the database, the flag `was_processed` is
set.

3.Lastly, in my `audiofile_detail.html` I added this code:

```html
{% if object.was_processed %}
<ul>
  <a href="{{ object.ac3_file.url}}">Ac3 File</a>
</ul>
<ul>
  <a href="{{ object.ogg_file.url}}">Ogg File</a>
</ul>
<ul>
  <a href="{{ object.wav_file.url}}">Wav File</a>
  <ul>
    {% endif %}
  </ul>
</ul>
```

## Logging

Right now everything works great but what if something goes wrong? To
make sure that I will be able to find the issue I need logging. This is
especially valuable for celery because Django doesn't show output from
Celery as it is a different application. So to setup basic logging I
need to add only a few things in `tasks.py`:

```python
from celery.utils.log import get_task_logger

logger = get_task_logger(__name__)


@app.task
def transcode_mp3(mp3_id):
    # ...

    logger.debug(
        'Created output files: %s, %s, %s.',
        ogg_output_file_path,
        ac3_output_file_path,
        wav_output_file_path
    )

    logger.info('Started transcoding.')
    # transcoding here
    logger.info('End of transcoding.')

    # rest of program ...
```

Thanks to that I can see in my console:

```bash
[2016-03-19 09:55:07,184: INFO/Worker-4] taskapp.tasks.transcode_mp3[b6ca93d4-e58c-496f-b8e5-4ba493b8a92a]: Started transcoding.
# transcoding ...
[2016-03-19 09:55:11,837: INFO/Worker-4] taskapp.tasks.transcode_mp3[b6ca93d4-e58c-496f-b8e5-4ba493b8a92a]: End of transcoding.
```

## Summary

I made basic transcoder application that uses FFmpeg, Django, Celery and RabbitMQ. I
learned quite a bit about how celery works with rabbitmq and django.
Thanks to that I stumbled upon some useful blog
[posts](https://denibertovic.com/posts/celery-best-practices/). I also
see some issues with my solutions. For instance todays AudioFile detail
view. I'm thinking about other ways to solve this problem because right
now I need 2 operations on database for one file. Maybe you know
solution to this? I'm really keen to hear about your view on this issue
or other comments so feel free to write comments or send me an email!
Thanks to all people who give me feedback- I really appreciate this!
