Rating: 7/10

Second part of Fred the Vampire Accountant series with more stories about parahuman side of life. As this is a second part of series I was little worried that this book won't be as good as the first one. To my relief it wasn't the case for this one.

I liked a plot & stories that was presented in the book - it was fun summer read.

Book can be found on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Undeath-Taxes-Fred-Book-2-ebook/dp/B012P8CF6Q).
