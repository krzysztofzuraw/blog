After one week of break I'm back with two links for this week reads.

- [Using Composition in React to Avoid "Prop Drilling" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=3XaXKiXtNjw). This one is one of the pattern you can consider using before you jump into context in React. It is called <q>Composition Pattern</q> and exposes props by composing children components. To learn more I recommend to follow the link.
- [Web Browser Engineering](https://browser.engineering/). This is books describes how web browser works and more importantly you are the one that will write one (browser) with help of the author.
