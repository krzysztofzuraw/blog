title: Tooling overload in JS
date: 2020-11-26

Before I start let me clarify what I mean by tooling in the context of programming language: all ecosystem of tools/libraries/frameworks that are needed to use with a given programming language.

When Iâ€™m thinking about tooling and how cumbersome it can be the first thing that comes to my mind is JavaScript. You probably heard of the black hole of node modules or [days since the last JavaScript framework website](https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/). It means that either ecosystem is a black mess with a huge dependency list and new dependencies come every day.

## Why is that?

I read somewhere that JavaScript as an ecosystem is a baby. It means that we have many [responsibilities](https://css-tricks.com/the-widening-responsibility-for-front-end-developers) and so little knowledge about how to handle such a range of responsibilities. Where can we learn? Maybe we can look into other languages - how & what they are doing?

I think you expect me to write about how beautifully other languages are doing the things that JavaScript cannot or not yet done. Sorry to disappoint you - but I donâ€™t. I think I donâ€™t know enough yet to do this. But I can give an example of my journey with one piece of the tooling ecosystem - bundlers.

## Example from my work

I wanted to develop React & Typescript application. In a typical situation,you expect me to use something like [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). I personally like to set up my own tooling and choose parts of the toolchain instead of being surprised when I eject.

I choose a [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as a main piece of the toolchain.â€Œ Why? It is the easiest to start and I donâ€™t need to write any config. I added [ant design](https://ant.design/) too.

Two weeks of development passed and I need to render the [Table](https://ant.design/components/table/#header). I import it via `import {Table} from 'antd'` and tried to run the project in development mode. I got an error telling me that `parcel` canâ€™t create a JavaScript bundle. I started searching around the web for this problem.

After a while, I found a corresponding issue inside ant design GitHub repository. The main conclusion was that table wonâ€™t work with `parcel`. I checked issue tracker inside `parcel` repository to see that issue was stale. I had two options there - either fix the issue or change the bundler to one that works with antd.

I choose webpack as it is a recommend bundler to use with antd. I have to migrate the application from parcel to webpack. I started by adding TypeScript and Babel plugins & configs. After that, I need to add [emotion.js](https://emotion.sh/) babel plugins in proper versions in order for `css prop` to work. I the meantime I forgot about `less` loader for antd - I had to add it as well.

It took about 3 hours of running `webpack` server, fixing building errors, fixing TypeScript errors but in the end I made it!. No errors from `tsc`, no errors from `eslint` (which setup requires additional 5 packages in order it to work with TS), no errors from `npm run dev`. Iâ€™m done here ðŸŽ‰.

Until the next update of webpack or babel or any part of the toolchain.

## Summary

This was a mind dump about the tooling ecosystem in JavaScript world. I wrote about my problems with ant design in conjunction with `parcel`. Takeaway? It is hard but we are moving in a good direction.
