I’ve decided to write this blog post for myself so I can have a clear picture of my progress. I am planning to update this post regularly with my progress. As you may know from [previous blog post](https://krzysztofzuraw.com/blog/2019/career-change) I want to change my career. As I’m not that proficient in CSS & HTML I decided to create some kind of map with checkpoints.

## What I don’t know

### Implementing other designs

### Menus

### Inputs & forms

### Icons

### SVGs

### Backgrounds

### CSS methodologies

### SCSS/Sass

### Layouts

### Animations

## Summary

I decided to write down what I don’t know from CSS & HTML world. Above you can find headlines with topics that I want to tackle.
