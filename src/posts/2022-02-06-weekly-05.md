In this week reads:

- [The curse of the perfect tool â€“ Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-curse-of-the-perfect-tool). This blog post resonates with me a lot. I always were looking for the best and perfect tool for anything: todo, budget or coding. Maybe it is time to revisit this approach and use what I already have?

- [soheilpro/mailwind: Use Tailwind CSS to design HTML emails](https://github.com/soheilpro/mailwind). Interesting approach to creating HTML emails. I will have to try it with the next project.
