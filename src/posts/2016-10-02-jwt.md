**Recently I attended a workshop about web security. During these hours
I learnt quite a lot but one thing got my attention- JWT.**

## What is JWT?

JWT aka JSON Web Tokens is a method of authentication. What it does: You
as a user first send a request to the server saying: I want to login!
And server gives you in response a long sequence of characters. As you
get this sequence you can use it as a way to tell the server that you
are the person you really are.

In a more technical sense: you send a request which logs you to service
for example headers with login and password. In response, you got
encrypted token. Then you want to get some info about another resource
on the server that requires authentication. So to your request you
add one more header with previously received token and that's
all! You are authenticated.

JSON Web Token looks like this:

```text
HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE
```

The header is a JSON that consists of a type of token (JWT) and which
hash algorithm will be used (HMAC SHA256 or RSA). HMAC stands for
keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code. Message Authentication Code
(MAC) is used to confirm that message comes from the good sender and its
integrity has not been changed. Keyed-Hash stands for hashing MAC in
combination with a secret key.

The payload contains the claims. Claim store information user wants to
transmit and server can use to properly handle authentication. There are
a lot of registered claims but we will use only:

- "exp" (Expiration Time) Claim
- "nbf" (Not Before Time) Claim
- "iss" (Issuer) Claim
- "aud" (Audience) Claim
- "iat" (Issued At) Claim

Payload will look like this:

```json
{
  "exp": "1234567890",
  "name": "Krzysztof Zuraw"
}
```

Last part is a signature. It is the sum of all previously
mentioned parts encoded in base64 + secret.

## How can you use JWT and why?

When you get your response back from a server with JSON Web Token you
can use it in header like this:

```shell
Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>
```

In comparison with another method of authentication: SAML, JWT is more
compact. JSON format is widely used in programming word so there is no
problem with parsers for that format.

## Overview of application

The main goal of this application is to create tasks. Each task has a
title - string with a maximum length of 100 characters. Task also has a
person to which it is bound (many to one relation - ForeginKey). The
last thing that task have is date and time which given task is due to.
The user can easily modify each of tasks so GET, POST, PUT and DELETE
methods are supported.

As we know how the application is designed let's jump into the code.

## Application code

First, there is a need to create model for Task:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


class Task(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    person = models.ForeignKey(User)
    due_to = models.DateTimeField()

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Task with title: {}'.format(self.title)
```

The arguments of `Task` correspond to what was written in the overview.

As we have models ready now it's time to create serializers so data from
database can be converted to stream of bytes:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Task
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


class TaskSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Task


class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = User
```

As you can see in `TaskSerializer` I used `HyperlinkedModelSerializer`
as a type of serializer that I want to use - thanks to that response
from my application will have hyperlinks to resources instead of
primary keys that are used in `UserSerializer`. In this serializer, I
use django `User` as a source of data. I have to do this because `Task`
model has a reference to `User` and without serialization of the second
one I cannot serialize the task.

Right now I have my models and serializers ready so it's time to create
some views and urls. For a typical usage of views, DRF gives you generic
viewsets like
[ModelViewSet](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#modelviewset).
ViewSet is a combination of the logic for a set of related views in a
single class. How do views look like?

```python
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Task
from .serializers import TaskSerializer, UserSerializer
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


class TaskViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Task.objects.all()
    serializer_class = TaskSerializer


class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
```

I created 2 viewsets. The only thing that I need to provide is queryset
and `serializer_class` arguments so viewsets know which data they needed
to take and which serializer use. Right now there is only one thing
missing - urls:

```python
from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin
from tasks import views
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'tasks', views.TaskViewSet)
router.register(r'users', views.UserViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^', include(router.urls)),
]
```

Here I set up `DefaultRouter` and hook `TaskViewSet` and `UserViewSet`
to it. Router is a way of building common routes for a resource. To get
all tasks - I go to `/tasks` uri. To retrieve first task I type
`tasks/1`. I can write this in urlpatterns but the router is doing the
same for me automatically.

Right now I can try my application:

```shell
$ http GET 127.0.0.1:9000
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Sun, 23 Oct 2016 08:36:23 GMT
Server: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.5.1
Vary: Accept, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

{
    "tasks": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/tasks/",
    "users": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/users/"
}


$ http GET 127.0.0.1:9000/tasks/
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Allow: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json

[
    {
        "due_to": "2016-10-18T19:12:01Z",
        "person": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/users/1/",
        "title": "First one",
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/tasks/1/"
    },
    {
        "due_to": "2016-10-18T19:12:10Z",
        "person": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/users/1/",
        "title": "Second one",
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/tasks/2/"
    }
]
```

## JWT in Django Rest Framework

There are few packages on
[pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=JWT&submit=search)
that provide JWT support but as I am already using DRF I choose package
called [REST framework JWT
Auth](https://github.com/GetBlimp/django-rest-framework-jwt). It's
simple package and does it's job well so I can recommend it to everyone.
But you have to make sure that your application is behind SSL/TLS as JWT
tokens generated are not signed. But enough writing- let's jump into the
code.

## Implementing JWT in DRF application

First I added small change to my `Task` model definition in models.py:

```python
class Task(models.Model):
    # rest of model
    person = models.ForeignKey('auth.User', related_name='tasks')
    # rest of model
```

It is the same model definition but written using string. The code in
Django responsible for model lookup based on the string can be seen
[here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/_modules/django/apps/config/#AppConfig.get_model).

Then I added an additional field to `UserSerializer`- thanks to that
when getting info about the user I also get info about which tasks this
user has. It can be accomplished by:

```python
class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    tasks = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(
        many=True, queryset=Task.objects.all()
    )

    # rest of the code
```

As I got my models and serializers ready I need views:

```python
from rest_framework import permissions


class TaskViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    # rest of the code

    permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,)


class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    # rest of the code

    permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,)
```

I added `permission_classes` to tell DRF that these views are read only
when the user is not authenticated. If I send a token ( or authenticate
in another way) I am able to modify data kept under this view. To
authenticate I needed a new endpoint so there's a small change to
urls.py:

```python
from rest_framework_jwt.views import obtain_jwt_token

urlpatterns = [
    # rest of the code
    url(r'^api-auth/', obtain_jwt_token),
]
```

Right now the user firsts need to authenticate using this endpoint. In
return, endpoint gives back a token. Last thing to let this work is to
tell Django Rest Framework that I want to use JWT as a basic type of
authentication in settings.py:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_jwt.authentication.JSONWebTokenAuthentication',
    )
}
```

And that's it! JWT should be working:

```shell
$ http GET 127.0.0.1:9000/tasks/
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Allow: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Sat, 29 Oct 2016 13:10:52 GMT

      "person": "admin",
      "title": "First one",
  },
  {
      "due_to": "2016-10-18T19:12:10Z",
      "person": "admin",
      "title": "Second one",
  }
]

$ cat create_task.json
{
  "due_to": "2016-10-18T19:12:01Z",
  "person": 1,
  "title": "Next one",
}

$ http POST 127.0.0.1:9000/tasks/ < create_task.json
HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized

Vary: Accept
WWW-Authenticate: JWT realm="api"
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

{
    "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

To send POST you need:

```shell
$ http POST 127.0.0.1:9000/api-auth/ username=admin password=admin
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Allow: POST, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json

}
