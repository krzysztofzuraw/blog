**Hello in the new year - 2017! I wish you all good things! Today's post
will be about one year of this very blog and other things that I was
able to accomplish in the previous year. This blog post won't contain
code so if you are hungry for that please wait one more week.**

## Projects that I did

I really like doing things and based on that learning form it. Recently
I read a couple of good pieces about why this is important from people
that I personally admire: [piece
one](https://www.pydanny.com/code-code-code.html) & [piece
two](https://github.com/wesbos/ama/issues/62).

So I did a couple of projects that I wouldn't have done if I hadn't had
this blog, you can find them under [this github
repo](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/personal-blog-projects). I also
created a small prototype of an application that works with docker
python api:
[tdd-app-prototype](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/tdd-app-prototype).
What is more, in my work I started using puppet so I did a simple puppet
& vagrant project for provisioning django application using this tool:
[vagrant-puppet](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/vagrant-puppet). I
wrote a small project that is using reddit api and I learnt about ports
& adapters:
[reddit-stars](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/reddit-stars). The last
project that I did last year was simple web crawler:
[histmag-to-kindle](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/histmag_to_kindle).

I also started one project:
[poznaj](https://github.com/kj-wroclaw/poznaj-backend) that I'm working
on in my free time.

## Conferences, events that I went & speeches that I had

I happened to be at 2 conferences previous year:
PyConPl and Django Under The Hood. I also did become a mentor in
Django Girls Kraków.

I did one speech about
[microservices](http://www.slideshare.net/Krzysztofuraw/wrocpy-32-microservices-in-flask)
during [wrocpy](https://www.meetup.com/wrocpy/).

## Open source contributions

This is the area that I can work on more - I made a contribution to
[python-libarchive-c](https://github.com/Changaco/python-libarchive-c).
It was my first open source contribution! I was so happy that I helped
this project. But there are more things that I can do. I realize that
most of the people who are involved in open source are doing it in only
a couple of projects. It can be connected with that, every project that
you are working with you need to know a little bit more and after that
you can start contributing more - it takes time and dedication. That's
why I want to work a little bit more on [mozilla
addons-server](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server). I assigned
myself to one of the issues there but I haven't had time to work on
them. It's high time to fix that. I also joined Django Under The Hood to
contribute more to Django but I was able only to work on some
documentation fix.

That all for today! It was my short summary of the previous year! Thanks
for reading and see you next week.

Special thanks to Kasia for being an editor for this post. Thank you.
