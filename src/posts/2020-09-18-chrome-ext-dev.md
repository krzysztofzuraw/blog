title: Setting up webpack for chrome extension development

Today I learned how to setup [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for chrome extension development.
In this post I will show you how I did it. To start, you need to install webpack and packages
from webpack ecosystem:

```shell
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli html-webpack-plugin clean-webpack-plugin copy-webpack-plugin
```

First step done - now it is getting tricky. How to lay out development & production config to avoid
nested ternary operators as you donâ€™t want to spend 3 days setting up everything?

Create `webpack.common.js`. Here you gonna put common settings that will be used by both development & production config:

```js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require("clean-webpack-plugin");
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  entry: { popup: "./src/popup/index.tsx", background: "./src/background/index.ts" },
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.tsx?$/, use: "ts-loader", exclude: /node_modules/ }], // do not forget to change/install your own TS loader
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".tsx", ".ts", ".js"],
  },
  plugins: [
    new CleanWebpackPlugin({ cleanStaleWebpackAssets: false }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: "src/popup/index.html" }),
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: "./src/manifest.json" },
        { from: "./src/icons/icon16.png" },
        { from: "./src/icons/icon48.png" },
        { from: "./src/icons/icon128.png" },
      ],
    }),
  ],
  output: { filename: "[name].js", path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist") }, // chrome will look for files under dist/* folder
};
```

Config above have 2 entry points - because I am using both popup and background scripts.

Webpack's development config is a merge between `common` & `dev` configs:

```js
const { merge } = require("webpack-merge");
const common = require("./webpack.common.js");

module.exports = merge(common, {
  mode: "development",
  devtool: "inline-source-map",
});
```

Prod configuration is following the same pattern:

```js
const { merge } = require("webpack-merge");
const common = require("./webpack.common.js");

module.exports = merge(common, {
  mode: "production",
});
```

Lastly I have two commands for webpack

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack --watch --config webpack.dev.js",
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js"
  }
}
```

Below you have diagram presenting how `npm start` is working under the hood

All you need to do after running `npm start` is to tell chrome that there is unpacked extension in the `dist/*` folder. To do that you need to go to `chrome://extensions/` and select options which are visible in the picture below (numbers indicate ordered selection of buttons/switches):

## Summary

In today's blog post I described setting up webpack for browser's extension development.
You can check a working example in my latest side project - [rabat](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/rabat).
