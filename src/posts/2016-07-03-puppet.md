**This post is a quick tutorial how to provision geodjango application
using puppet. While writing this tutorial I have taken the approach that
I start with running code and then refactor this to something better.**

Firstly what is puppet? From their
[website](https://puppet.com/product/how-puppet-works) :

> Puppet provides a standard way of delivering and operating software,
> no matter where it runs. With the Puppet approach, you define what you
> want your apps and infrastructure to look like using a common
> language.

So it's a tool for automatic deployment. Other choices are:
[fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) or
[ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). I've chosen this tool first because
I use it in my work as a tool for automation as well as I was keen to
look more how this all works.

Puppet is different from other mentioned tools in a way it does
_deployment_: there are two entities: puppet master and a puppet agent.
Master is responsible for keeping the configuration how puppet agent
should look like. When puppet is run it pulls out information from
puppet master and apply to puppet agent. In other words, puppet agent
doesn't have information about its configuration directly- it pulls this
from puppet master. Other tools have a different approach: to push
configuration via SSH.

To play with puppet I decided to choose my project: [geodjango +
leaflet](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/geodjango-leaflet). As I said
before to run puppet you have to have two machines: puppet master +
puppet agent. Fortunately, there is a way to develop puppet modules
(module is responsible for configuration of one thing: like module for
PostgreSQL or APT) via [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

This tool is so awesome that it allows you to have puppet master and
agent on the same machine. How to do this? After installing Vagrant &
VirtualBox place a file called Vagrantfile inside your project folder:

```ruby
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
    config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"

  config.vm.provision :shell do |shell|
    shell.inline = "mkdir -p /etc/puppet/modules;
                    puppet module install puppetlabs-stdlib;
                    puppet module install ripienaar-concat;
                    puppet module install puppetlabs-apt;
                    puppet module install puppetlabs/postgresql;
                    puppet module install puppetlabs/vcsrepo;
                    puppet module install puppetlabs-git;
                    puppet module install arioch-redis;
                    puppet module install ajcrowe-supervisord;
                    puppet module install jfryman-nginx"
  end

  config.vm.provision "puppet" do |puppet|
        puppet.options = ["--templatedir","/vagrant/templates"]
  end

end
```

In this file, I set up ip address of machine: `192.168.33.10` as
well as what OS will be inside vagrant: `ubuntu/trusty64`. Right after
that, I tell vagrant to execute shell commands for creating a directory
structure for puppet modules as well as install those modules that I
will need later. At the end, I tell vagrant to run puppet with template
directory. If you wanted to run this few times you can add to every
puppet module install flag `--force` at the end of command like
`puppet module install puppetlabs-stdlib --force;`.

Now I can move on to puppet code itself. Puppet modules have to be under
folder called manifests. The name of pp file is right now not important
so I left it as default value- `default.pp`. So what is in this
file?

At the top I declared bunch of postgresql statements:

```puppet
# required to postgresql resources to work
class { 'postgresql::server':  }
# required by geodjango
class {'postgresql::server::postgis': }
# create db
postgresql::server::db { 'geodjango':
  user     => $title,
  password => $title,
}

postgresql_psql { 'Add password to role':
  db      => 'geodjango',
  command => "ALTER ROLE geodjango WITH PASSWORD 'geodjango';",
  require => Postgresql::Server::Role['geodjango'],
}
# create geodjango role
postgresql::server::role {'geodjango':;}

postgresql::server::database_grant { 'grant ALL privilleges for user geodjango':
  privilege => 'ALL',
  db        => 'geodjango',
  role      => 'geodjango',
}

postgresql_psql { 'Enable postgis extension':
  db      => 'geodjango',
  command => 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis;',
  unless  => "SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname ='postgis'",
  require => Postgresql::Server::Db['geodjango'],
}
```

As you can see the puppet syntax is straightforward. To read more about
classes in puppet go
[there](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_classes.html).
I added one thing that can be not clear:
`require => Postgresql::Server::Role['geodjango']`. It tells puppet that
first `postgresql::server::role` resource needs to be applied. This is
how to create dependencies.

So I've setup database needed for geodjango application, but there are
more dependencies for geodjango- GIS libraries. How to install them via
puppet:

```puppet
package {
  'binutils':  ensure                 => present;
  'libproj-dev': ensure               => present;
  'gdal-bin': ensure                  => present;
  'postgresql-server-dev-9.3': ensure => present;
  'build-essential': ensure           => latest;
  'python3': ensure                   => latest;
  'python3.4-dev': ensure             => latest;
  'python3-setuptools': ensure        => latest;
  'python3-pip': ensure               => latest;
  'python3.4-venv': ensure            => latest;
  'python-pip': ensure                => present;
}
```

I've used redis for my application so I need it too. I've default config
for redis and I don't need to specify additional arguments for this
resource:

```puppet
class { 'redis':;}
```

I don't like when application is run by root user that's why I created a
special dedicated one only for my application. I also like to keep my
code on machines under `/opt/name_of_project` path so I created this
too:

```puppet
user { 'geodjango':
  ensure     => present,
  managehome => true,
}

file { ['/opt/geodjango/','/opt/geodjango/geodjango']:
  ensure => 'directory',
  owner  => 'geodjango'
}
```

For running my application I need it source code which is under git. To
download it to vagrant machine I use:

```puppet
include git

vcsrepo { '/opt/geodjango/geodjango':
  ensure   => latest,
  provider => git,
  source   => 'https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/geodjango-leaflet.git',
  user     => 'geodjango',
  force     => true,
}
```

In `vcsrepo`, I added parameter `force` to make sure that repo is
updated with new commits if it already exists on my deployed machine.
It's a good practice in python word to have isolated environments per
application. In python 3 there is a tool for that in standard library
called [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). How to
create such virutal enviroment? By invoking similar command in shell:

```shell
python3 -m venv /opt/geodjango/env
```

As it is the command that is run in the shell, puppet has the special
resource to handling these cases: `exec`. How to use it? It's simple:

```puppet
exec { 'create venv':
  command => 'python3 -m venv /opt/geodjango/env',
  path    => '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin',
  require => Vcsrepo['/opt/geodjango/geodjango'],
}
```

I'm telling puppet to execute `command` that is in `path`. I decided
that this command will be run only when there are changes in the repo.
That's why `require` argument.

Right now I created virtual environment. It's time to install python
packages that are needed for proper operation of the whole application.
I've used so-called
[requirements.txt](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html).
To install packages from that file via puppet I need:

```puppet
exec { 'install requirements':
  command => '/opt/geodjango/env/bin/pip install --requirement /opt/geodjango/geodjango/requirements.txt',
  path    => '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin',
  require => Exec['create venv']
}
```

I specify here full paths for `pip` as well as for `requirements` file.

As everything is installed I need a tool for managing my geodjango
application. I can do this by invoking django command `runserver` as a
deamon. But there is a tool designed especially for that-
[supervisor](http://supervisord.org/). How does it works? You specify in
ini file which commands needs to be run by supervisor. In addition to
that, you can see if your command run was successful or not. To use
supervisor you need:

```puppet
include ::supervisord

supervisord::program { 'django':
  command     => '/opt/geodjango/env/bin/gunicorn geodjango_leaflet.wsgi -b 127.0.0.1:9000',
  user        => 'geodjango',
  directory   => '/opt/geodjango/geodjango',
  subscribe   => Vcsrepo['/opt/geodjango/geodjango'],
}
```

At the top, I included supervisord resource. `D` at the end stands for
the daemon. Right below that I setup program `django` which is a simple
gunicorn command run by user geodjango inside specified directory.

I have my app running via gunicorn managed by supervisor but there is
one more thing: web server. In my apps I use nginx so I'm gonna setup
that:

```puppet
class {'nginx':
  confd_purge  => true,
  vhost_purge  => true,
}

$nginx_settings = {
  'upstream_name'    => 'geodjango',
  'upstream_address' => '127.0.0.1:9000',
}

file { ["/etc/nginx/sites-available/geodjango.conf","/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/geodjango.conf" ] :
  ensure   => file,
  content  => template('nginx.erb'),
  notify   => Service['nginx']
}
```

Starting from the top: I configured class nginx to do not setup conf.d
files as well as vhost ones. Right after that, I defined puppet variable
`$nginx_settings` which is a hash. I will be using this variable in
resource `file` where I tell puppet to setup file in `sites-available`
as well as in `sites-enabled`. Content of this file is present in
template `nginx.erb`:

```ruby
upstream <%= @nginx_settings['upstream_name'] %> {
  server <%= @nginx_settings['upstream_address'] %>;
}

server {

    location /static {
        alias /opt/geodjango/static;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://<%= @nginx_settings['upstream_name'] %>;
    }
}
```

As you can see I use `nginx_settings` inside my template. It's because
puppet takes variables for the local scope of given module- in this case
`default.pp`. It's good to know that they are two types of templates
that puppet can use- one erb style (ruby) that I currently used in this
example and puppet style
([epp](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_template_epp.html)).

There are three more things to do: first to run database migrations,
load initial data to the database and the third one to collect static
files. I want to do them manually but here is puppet code if you are
interested:

```puppet
exec { 'run django migrations':
  command     => '/opt/geodjango/env/bin/python /opt/geodjango/geodjango/manage.py migrate --no-input',
  path        => '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin',
  require     => Exec['install requirements'],
  subscribe   => Postgresql_psql['Add password to role'],
  refreshonly => true,
}

exec { 'load initial data to db':
  command     => '/opt/geodjango/env/bin/python /opt/geodjango/geodjango/manage.py loaddata',
  path        => '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin',
  require     => Exec['install requirements'],
  subscribe   => Postgresql_psql['Add password to role'],
  refreshonly => true,
}

exec { 'collect static files':
  command     => '/opt/geodjango/env/bin/python /opt/geodjango/geodjango/manage.py collectstatic --noinput',
  path        => '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin',
  require     => Exec['install requirements'],
  subscribe   => Vcsrepo['/opt/geodjango/geodjango'],
  refreshonly => true,
}
```

All these 3 commands are django one (loaddata is made by myself). To use
them with puppet you need to specify them under `exec` resource.

That's all for this time. To sum these two articles up: I really enjoyed
playing with puppet. Especially this clear syntax that puppet provides.
I also like that you can even write a tests for puppet code! Having two
machines (puppet master & agent) for provisioning is good because you
can have real time update of your agent machine but requiers resources.

What is more I currently use vagrant with default config which is not
good- not enough RAM on client machine forces puppet run to stop. I
could set it up for higher value but my computer isn't' good enough. To
bypass this I have plan to use docker with puppet master and agent.
Lastly installing every time puppet modules in Vagrantfile isn't good
idea- that's another thing to change and maybe use something like
[puppet-librarian](http://librarian-puppet.com/)?

Source code for this is avaiable
[here](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/vagrant-puppet).
