Book is about alt-med movement and how we what we can learn while trying to fight it with science. Every chapter is about different alternative medicine technique starting from anty-vacines, homeopathy and ending with pure water. What is nice about this book is fact that author do not try to describe people who believe in those techniques as idiots - which is so common in media nowadays. Instead he tries to use science to describe why e.g homeopathy can't work. I recommend this book if you have alt-med friends or just want to know a bit more about those movements and what is rationale behind them.
