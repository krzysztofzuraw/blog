Imagine that you have flex container. It have `max-width` of `300px`. Inside this container
there is a wall of text. In all browsers except ie11 everything works fine:

{% img "2019-10-12-content", "Content", "Content" %}

In ie11 content overflows (example from [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-x)):

{% img "2019-10-12-ie11", "IE11", "IE11" %}

How this can be fixed? By adding `width: 100%` to children of `flex` element.
