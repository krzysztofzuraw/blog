## [A simple boilerplate for using NPM tasks to build and compile JavaScript, CSS, and image files.](https://github.com/cferdinandi/build-tool-boilerplate)

Nice tooling for plain JS, HTML & CSS. Img compresion is also nice - but it turns out that lib in this GitHub repo is no longer maintained and you should use [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/).

## [A New Container Query Polyfill That Just Works | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/a-new-container-query-polyfill-that-just-works/)

It is nice that container query is comming to the browsers - we do not have yet stable browser implementation but we have polyfill already. I think I will still pass on using that and wait for the final implementation.

## [A zero config, framework free Netlify Identity widget](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget)

Auth for static websites. Looks like Netlify wants to take a bit of Auth0 space - especially if you are already in Netlify ecosystem for static sites.

## [Kill the Newsletter!](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/)

Really nice idea - subscribe to newsletters as they were RSS feeds. Similar feature is in subscription based [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/).

## [Omni](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni)

Command pallette for chromium based browsers - in try this out phase for me.

## [My first impressions of web3](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html)

Article about web3 apps development - pros/cons and are they any different from what we have now?
