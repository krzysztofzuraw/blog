description: "How to play old classic games on your mac and how to add DuckDuckGo site search to your website."
---

This week links include:

- [Mac Source Ports](https://macsourceports.com/). If you want to play old games on your mac - this is a website you can look into. It also has a nice write-up about almost every game on the list.
- [usesthis/default.erb at main Â· waferbaby/usesthis](https://github.com/waferbaby/usesthis/blob/main/templates/default.erb#L58). I recently found out a nice feature on [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/) - ability to use DuckDuckGo search. As the source code is open I took it and make my search form for this site. I forgot how easy and clean is to use plain HTML forms.
