example of doing one thing well using declarative programming. I see connections with concepts of functional programming.

## Line height in CSS & Design

[How to tame line height in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-tame-line-height-in-css/). Nice read about
how designers perceive leading and how it is connected with `line-height`. I think it will be nice to

designs ðŸ¤”. Overall nice idea of having common ground between designers and developers.

created using only CSS.

problems on the web e.g styling buttons or centering. Recommended.
