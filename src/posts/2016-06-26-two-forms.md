title: Two forms one view in django

**This post is a reference for myself how to do a simple thing like
rendering two forms in one view using django framework.**

How will it be working? The idea is very simple. There will be only one
view to render both forms. Moreover, only GET method will be implemented
to this view so there won't be a possibility to send POST request.
Underneath the first main view will be 2 more views responsible only for
handling POST request for both of forms. The simple picture presenting
this can be seen below:

{% img "2016-06-26-diagram", "Diagram presenting flow of request" %}

Let's jump into the code. At first, there is main view responsible for
rendering forms:

```python
class MainView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'sample_forms/index.html'

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        question_form = QuestionForm(self.request.GET or None)
        answer_form = AnswerForm(self.request.GET or None)
        context = self.get_context_data(**kwargs)
        context['answer_form'] = answer_form
        context['question_form'] = question_form
        return self.render_to_response(context)
```

This is simple `TemplateView` which is responsible only for GET request.
At first, my setup question and answer form from the request. Right
after that I add these forms to context dictionary and render them on
`sample_forms/index.html`.

My `sample_forms/index.html` looks as follows:

{% raw %}

```html
<h1>Question Form</h1>
<form action="{% url 'question' %}" method="post">{% csrf_token %}
    {{ question_form }}
    <input type="submit" value="Send Question">
</form>
<h1>Answer Form</h1>
<form action="{% url 'answer' %}" method="post">{% csrf_token %}
    {{ answer_form }}
<input type="submit" value="Send Answer">
</from>
```

{% endraw %}

I render both with different action so sending post request will point
to different URL: question form to `question_form/submit` and answer
form to `answer_form/submit`.

Take a look into view responsible for handling POST request for both
forms:

```python
class QuestionFormView(FormView):
    form_class = QuestionForm
    template_name = 'sample_forms/index.html'
    success_url = '/'

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        question_form = self.form_class(request.POST)
        answer_form = AnswerForm()
        if question_form.is_valid():
            question_form.save()
            return self.render_to_response(
                self.get_context_data(
                success=True
            )
        )
        else:
        return self.render_to_response(
        self.get_context_data(
                question_form=question_form,

        )


class AnswerFormView(FormView):
    form_class = AnswerForm
    template_name = 'sample_forms/index.html'
    success_url = '/'

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        answer_form = self.form_class(request.POST)
        question_form = QuestionForm()
        if answer_form.is_valid():
            answer_form.save()
            return self.render_to_response(
                self.get_context_data(
                success=True
            )
        )
        else:
            return self.render_to_response(
            self.get_context_data(
                    answer_form=answer_form,
                    question_form=question_form
            )
        )
```

They are almost the same so I describe only one of them:
`QuestionFormView`. In `post`, I instantiate `question_form` with POST
request with user input. Right after that, I initialize empty
`answer_form` because when the first form will have some errors I want
to present them and the second form. Without that only form with errors
will be rendered. Next lines are simple: check if forms have errors: if
not save the form and render `index.html` with additional data
`success`. Why? Because I can render on the same page information for
the user that request was sent like:

{% raw %}

```html
{% if success %}
<h1>Your request has been submitted</h1>
{% else %} # Forms here {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

If the user input was invalid I render both forms: one with errors and
other without.
