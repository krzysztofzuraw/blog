It is a journal where author writes its own thought on new wave of stoicism. What I like about new wave of stoicism (called reformed) is that it tries to be more practical and less philosophical. And it more up to date with modern world. A lot has changed since Seneca or Marcus Aurelius so it is nice to read a bit more about how to apply stoicism in modern world.
