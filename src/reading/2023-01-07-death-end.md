Last book in series Remembrance of Earth's Past. I would say it is epic novel and it is very scientific. I would recommend it to everyone who likes sci-fi. Some parts of the book are very hard to understand, but it is worth it. I would say that it is one of the best books I have ever read. It seems like I was reading Lem's books but more modern.
