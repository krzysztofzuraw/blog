The second book from the Poppy War series. It started nice and exciting but in the second part of the book, I felt like it went down. I saw the same patterns as in the previous book so it was a bit boring. Still, I think it describes war times pretty accurately. The Polish version was ok. You can find the book in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41118857-the-dragon-republic).
