Book about [Second Polish Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic) and relations between minorities. The main character is a boxer & gangster. I like this book because of good language that is written with. Good for summer reading & relaxing.

English edition known as [The King of Warsaw: A Novel](https://www.amazon.com/King-Warsaw-Novel-Szczepan-Twardoch/dp/1542044448).
