English - [Thief of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_of_Time). Really nice book from
Discworld series. This is the last book of miniseries about Death and I really liked it.
Overall series about Death is more enjoyable than series about Rincewind - I get bored quickly and
after a few books the same pattern of writing narrating the story emerges. Here it was a bit different.
