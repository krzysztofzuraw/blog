The most interesting in this book were descriptions of how Polish cities are coping with climate change. Anwer - they do not. Instead of planting new trees, they are removing existing ones. Their place is taken by concrete.

I liked parts about the USA and their way from public transport to private cars and how this leads to building new roads and removing green areas from cities. The same movement was happening in the west before 60-ties. It seems that Poland is at the beginning of talking about how trees and green can help people in the cities.
