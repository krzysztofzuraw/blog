I recently was setting up new Next.js project with environmental variables. Next supports them out of the box I wanted a bit more typing than `string | undefined`. I couldn't find it easily on Google so I created this post.

First create `env.d.ts` in root of your repository with environmental variables keys

```ts
namespace NodeJS {
  interface ProcessEnv {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: string;
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: string;
  }
}
```

Second add `env.d.ts` to `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // options are here
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "env.d.ts"] // see the last entry in array
}
```
