It's a bit after a new year but I'm back with a new post about what tools and apps I'm using. I decided to remove `/uses` and redirect people to this post. I like idea of writing what I'm using at the end of the year.

# Hardware

- Apple MacBook Pro 16" 2021. It is nice laptop and works fine - what is the most important it is without radiator so everything is quiet. I'm using it with external monitor and keyboard in clamshell mode.
- [Dell U2720Q](https://www.dell.com/pl/firmiinstytucji/p/dell-u2720q-monitor/pd). It is 27" 4K monitor with 60Hz refresh rate. It works and do not have glare.
- Apple Magic Keyboard
- [Logitech MX Vertical](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.html). Awesome mouse - it makes my wrist happy.
- Pen & Paper. I'm using them to take meeting notes or write journal.
- [Bose QC35](https://www.bose.com/en_us/landing_pages/quietcomfort_35_wireless.html). As I'm working from home right now I'm using it to calls.
- AirPods 1st gen - I'm using them to listen to music or podcasts.
- iPhone 11. Have not changed it for a while. It works fine.
- iPad 6th gen. Mostly I'm using it on the couch to read RSS and Reddit.

# Software

- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). For all todo and projects.
- [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com/) with [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) as a backend. Awesome combination for reading RSS and newsletters. I like that Feedbin can take any amount of feeds I throw at it.
- Apple Notes. It works and has document scanner.
- Chrome. Main browser with few extensions.
  - uBlock Origin
  - [StopTheMadness](https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/). Totally recommend. It is only extension that allows to stop auto-playing videos on websites.
  - [Tweaks for Twitter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweaks-for-twitter/id1567751529?mt=12)
  - 1password
  - Video Speed Controller
- VS Code + SF Mono. For writing and coding.
- Raycast
- [Pandan](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pandan/id1569600264?mt=12). It informs me how much time I spend behind my computer and forces me to take a break.
- Apple Numbers.
- 1password.
- [Arq backup](https://www.arqbackup.com/) with AWS. Backups my data to cloud and local disk.
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/).
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/). The best screenshot tool for Mac.
- [DevUtils](https://devutils.com/). A collection of tools for developers.
- Flux
- Focus
- [noTunes](https://github.com/tombonez/noTunes). Blocks Apple Music from opening when I press `Play` button on my keyboard.
- Spotify
- [Carrot Weather](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/). Better weather than Apple Weather.
- [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/). I'm using it to listen to podcasts.
