Hello - this is the first of monthly updates. Let's get started with big news - I've joined [Saleor](https://saleor.io/) as a senior fronted developer. What this company is doing? Headless e-commerce which is really interesting - I also like emphasis on developers.

I've also joined [React Alicante](https://reactalicante.es/) conference. It was nice event with David K Piano talk at the top. I also enjoyed local cuisine and beautiful weather.

I started going back to the gym and walking with the dog as there is still around 20 degrees in Wroc≈Çaw with sun.

## Reading

- [Software engineering practices](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/1/software-engineering-practices/) which I found interesting as it sums up nicely my thoughts as well.
- [Poppy War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war). Fantasy book but nicely played and showing what does it means to have a war in your country.

## Watching

- [Disenchantment](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment_(TV_series)>). The newest series.Full of jokes and gags but sometimes a bit too much.
