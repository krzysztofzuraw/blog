In this blog post, I want to write about the last [Wroclaw TypeScript](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/WrocTypeScript/) meetup & encourage to take part
in the next one (disclaimer: I'm one of coorganizer).

You may ask what was so special about this meetup? It was the first one made online!

You know that all the current real-life events such as meetups are going so that is why we decided
to do the same. Fortunately, you need a youtube account to start streaming in those days so we don't need
to set up our own streaming.

How it went? You can see it on your own eyes on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fHBBiBGYio).
Our speaker [Alex Dodge](https://twitter.com/alexmdodge) gave a talk about state machines.
It was an interesting talk about how you can implement your own finite state machine and what are the
options if you want to use already existing libraries. Slides can be found on [google](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uEc9844u59ujNzE_gKDuB1hzi4B52oX3ZB37hQP8Mlc/edit#slide=id.g6c9450f387_0_52).

If you see youtube video you may notice cool transitions between different speakers or mc. As far as
I know there were made in After Effects by Damian - great work üëè.

But this is not the end! We have a new event coming.

It is planned on April 29th (Wed) at 18:30 CEST.
You can see what it will be in your [timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200429T163000&p1=664).

We planned two talks: `Code analysis and visual code representation` by [Mateusz StrƒÖg](https://twitter.com/MateuszStrag)
and `Pimp your codebase & scale it!` by [Mateusz Ziarko](https://linkedin.com/in/mateuszziarko).
You can RSVP on [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/WrocTypeScript/events/267280145/)
or ask youtube to remind you [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aZ8WMyJiWU&feature=youtu.be).

## Summary & TL;DR

There was the first [Wroclaw TypeScript](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/WrocTypeScript/) meetup online last month.
