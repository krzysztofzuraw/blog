The tools I use on a daily basis are as follows:

## Hardware

- I use an Apple MacBook Pro 16" (2021) as my laptop. It operates quietly without a fan and works well. I connect it to an external monitor and keyboard in clamshell mode.
- The monitor I use is the Dell U2720Q, a 27" 4K display with a 60Hz refresh rate. It provides a glare-free viewing experience.
- For my keyboard, I use the Apple Magic Keyboard.
- The Logitech MX Vertical is my preferred mouse. It provides ergonomic support and keeps my wrist comfortable.
- I rely on pen and paper for taking meeting notes and journaling.
- I use the Bose QC35 headphones for calls while working from home.
