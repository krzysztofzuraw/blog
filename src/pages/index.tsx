      <h3>Hello üëãüèª</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my personal site. I'm self-taught frontend developer. I enjoy working with
        TypeScript, React, Redux and RxJs. Previously I was coding in Python (mainly Django
        framework). You can find my projects on&nbsp;
        <Link to={site!.siteMetadata.social.github}>github</Link> and tools on&nbsp;
        <Link to="/uses">uses</Link> page. I have LinkedIn&nbsp;
        <Link to={site!.siteMetadata.social.linkedin}>too</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I'm not coding I like to brew some good coffee with Chemex or Aeropress. You can also
        find me in various food spots (tasty ones) around Wroc≈Çaw. I also like giving back to
        community so a few times I was a mentor on Django Girls (Wroc≈Çaw & Krak√≥w) and used to teach
        Python at Code Geeks Carrots Wroc≈Çaw (where I met my lovely girlfriend).
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to organize things. I'm coorganizer of&nbsp;
        <Link to="https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/WrocTypeScript/">Wroc≈Çaw TypeScript meetup</Link>.
        I'm helping in coordination of&nbsp;
        <Link to="https://djangogirls.org/wroclaw/">Django Girls Wroc≈Çaw</Link>. If you need a place
        & help with preparing some event do not hesitate to contact me (email is on the footer).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have monthly <Link to={site!.siteMetadata.social.newsletter}>newsletter</Link>. Last but
        not least, I have a&nbsp;
        <Link to={site!.siteMetadata.social.pinboard}>pinboard</Link> account where I keep
        interesting links.
      </p>
