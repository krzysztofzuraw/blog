      <h3>Hello üëãüèª</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my personal site. I'm self-taught frontend developer. I enjoy working with
        TypeScript, React, Redux and RxJs. Previously I was working with Python (mainly Django
        framework). You can find my projects on <Link to={social.github}>github</Link> and tools
        on&nbsp; <Link to="/uses">uses</Link> page. I have LinkedIn&nbsp;
        <Link to={social.linkedin}>too</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I'm not coding I like to brew good coffee with Chemex or Areopress. You can find me also
        in various food spots (tasty ones) around Wroc≈Çaw. I also like giving back to community so I
        was a few times mentor on Django Girls (Wroc≈Çaw & Krak√≥w). I used to teach Python at Code
        Geeks Carrots Wroc≈Çaw.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to organize things. I'm coorganizer of&nbsp;
        <Link to="https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/WrocTypeScript/">Wroc≈Çaw TypeScript meetup</Link>.
        I'm helping to organize&nbsp;
        <Link to="https://djangogirls.org/wroclaw/">Django Girls Wroc≈Çaw</Link>. If you need a place
        & help with organizing do not hesitate to contact me (email is on the footer).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have monthly <Link to={social.newsletter}>newsletter</Link>. Other than that I have&nbsp;
        <Link to={social.pinboard}>pinboard</Link> account where I keep interesting links.
      </p>
