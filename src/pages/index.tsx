        My name is Krzysztof ≈ªuraw. I'm self-taught frontend developer. I enjoy working with
        TypeScript + React.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I'm not coding I like to brew some good coffee with Chemex or Aeropress. You can also
        find me in various food spots (tasty ones) around Wroc≈Çaw. I also like giving back to
        community so a few times I was a mentor on Django Girls (Wroc≈Çaw & Krak√≥w) and used to teach
        Python at Code Geeks Carrots Wroc≈Çaw (where I met my lovely girlfriend).
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to organize things. I'm coorganizer of{' '}

        I'm helping in coordination of{' '}
