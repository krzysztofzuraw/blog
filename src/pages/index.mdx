# Hi, I'm Krzysztof ≈ªuraw üëãüèª

Welcome to my personal page. A few words about me:

- self taught frontend developer with 5+ years of experience
- specialise in building React & TypeScript websites/web-apps
- leading one of the dev teams at Ingrid
- learning about CSS & design
- brewing speciality coffee using Chemex

I‚Äôm currently living in Wroc≈Çaw but I‚Äôm open to working remotely or relocating.

I like giving back to community by being a mentor of [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) or [Geek Girls Carrots](https://gocarrots.org/). I like to organise events - I‚Äôm co-organizer of [Wroc≈Çaw TypeScript meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/WrocTypeScript/) and [Django Girls Wroc≈Çaw](https://djangogirls.org/wroclaw/). If you need help with preparing tech event do not hesitate to contact me.
