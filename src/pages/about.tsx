      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Krzysztof Żuraw</strong>. I'm currently working at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.ingrid.com">Ingrid</a> as a frontend developer and a team leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now I'm doing frontend work with TypeScript, React, Redux and RxJS. Previously I was
        working with Python (mainly Django framework).
      </p>
      <p>
        If I'm not coding I like to brew good coffee with Chemex or Areopress. You can find me also
        in various food spots (tasty ones) around Wrocław.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like giving back to community so I was a few times mentor on Django Grils (Wrocław &
        Kraków). I teach Python at Code Geeks Carrots Wrocław. I'm coorganizer of Wrocław TypeScript
        meetup.
