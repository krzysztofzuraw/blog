## CSS grid course

The course consists of 25 videos. Some of them are short and easy to digest but those at the end
are quite lengthy - so if you are coding along this may take some time. It took me about 1 month
of 30min every day to end this course.

Lessons from 1 to 11 and from 12 to 18 are mostly for explaining how all grid
properties work and how they fit together. The other lessons (11 and from 18 till 25) are for you
to code along or kept in style: you first code and then watch how Wes is doing the exercise.

Wes starts by describing most of (if not all) grid properties and what they
are doing. What is important - he is not doing it in an 'academic' way. You may ask what is an 'academic' way?

The academic way is describing the `grid-template-row` is a way that makes you wanna cry after 2 seconds
of watching. Something like: `grid-template-row` is the CSS property defines the line names and
track sizing functions of the grid rows. Why I don't like this approach? Because you don't have a clue
how to use `grid-template-row` in your code after sentence above.

Fortunately, Wes is showing CSS grid properties in practice and telling what each piece of syntax is doing.

I really enjoyed the cardio part - a part where you supposed to try first and then rewatch to see
if your solution was correct.

The last videos are pretty intense as you are suppose to code along with the author.

What is more, I like that he is giving tips & tricks that you can introduce in your day to day work as a web developer.
More importantly, I have a lot of ideas that I can right now work on my own and to be better at the CSS grid.

## Summary & TL;DR

I just ended watching [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) course by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) and I
can really recommend it. It is an introduction to CSS grid. In the end, you get an idea of how the CSS grid work
with different schemes for your [side projects](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/css-grid-coffee-shop).
