Last week joined the [UX/UI Space Wroc≈Çaw #8](https://www.meetup.com/UX-UI-Space-Wroclaw/events/268651212/) meetup. Below you can find my humble opinion about this event.

## Before meeting

I have to say I'm amazed by how many people want to come to this meetup! The meetup is traveling from place to place every month so a number of participants can vary. This month it was 70. Guess how fast those places went? **1 minute**. Yes - you read it well: **1 minute**. Good dammit I want the same at [Wroc≈Çaw TypeScript](https://www.meetup.com/WrocTypeScript/). I have to ask them how they are doing it.

This time venue was at Wroc≈Çaw [intive](https://www.intive.com/) office. It was nice - they even won some awards for this place. Anyway, let's go back to the talks.

## Talks

There were 3 talks with small community announcements at the end.

The first talk by [Dominik Pi≈Çat](https://www.behance.net/dominikpilat) was about receiving & giving feedback for your work. It was talk with a lot of memes and common knowledge. If someone wants and needs to work on giving/receiving feedback I recommend [WrocLove Speakers](https://www.facebook.com/wroclovespeakers/). Heads up - I a was member of that club and I totally recommend it!

The second talk by [Dorota Pƒôczek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorota-p%C4%99czek-148874105/) was really interesting. We dive into many different methodologies of working with clients. I really like this talk because for me it was UX/UI work from the kitchen. Most of the methods like A/B user testing or user personas resonate with me as I think to make better decisions in user-facing code we need to know the users.

The only thing I would improve is the volume of information - it was a huge piece of data to comprehend in such a short presentation. Talking more deeply about a few selected topics may yell better results. All in all great talk!

The last talk by [Magdalena Grudzie≈Ñ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magdalena-grudzien-a6bb28107/) was about tools used in design process. Nice talk - I learn about [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) or [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/).

## Summary & TL;DR

I attended [UX/UI Space Wroc≈Çaw #8]() meetup and I can recommend it to anyone. I learned quite a lot about the work of designers and I will come next time! They even have 2 [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) licenses to win at every meeting üéâ.
