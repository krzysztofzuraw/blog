In this blog post, I will write a little bit more about my career plans. It won't be a tutorial or technical blog post per se.

Recently I was thinking about my carrier. A little bit of context: I started as a Python developer, then after 2 years moved into JavaScript + TypeScript. While working closely with user-facing code I decided that I will move into user interfaces even more. It means that I want to work as a **developer who can design**. There is a notion of [a designer who can code]([https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/becoming-a-designer-who-codes/](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/becoming-a-designer-who-codes/)) but I want to emphasis that I'm a software developer who is going to enter design word.

# PARI

As I'm really keen on [learning in public]([https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/)) and [mindframing]([https://nesslabs.com/mindframing](https://nesslabs.com/mindframing)) I decided to try those ideas on this journey.

## Pact

I regularly commit to spending an hour (x5 per week) for 1h to work towards being developer + design. You can see my progress on [makerslog](https://getmakerlog.com/@krzysztof_zuraw)

## Act

This point is in essence:

- Learn & Read
- Writing blog posts
- Writing Today I learned
- Sharing knowledge on social media.

## React

I already have a few places that I can use to create my own content:

- Blog
- Newsletter
- Twitter feed

## Impact

I have a few side project ideas and at first, I want to split those into small areas. Then work with them and after that combine them into one project.

# Summary

I decided to be a developer and designer. In this blog & social media (mostly Twitter) I will document my journey. Let's get started 🎉
