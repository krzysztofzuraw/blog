# Coding

- [Design for Developers on Fronted Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/).
  This course by [Sarah Drasner](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/) blew my mind. I'm still in progress but
  every video that I watch has something interesting and awesome to show or explain.

- [The experimental layout lab of Jen Simmons](https://labs.jensimmons.com/). I've got this link from
  previously motioned course. Really nice resource to see how you can use a CSS to create a wonderful layout.
  Also, the code is really clean.

- [Table magic](https://stevecat.net/table-magic/). Really nice multi-format table generator / converter.
  For example, you can convert CSV to a markdown table.

- [React debugging session](https://jkettmann.com/react-debugging-session-hundreds-of-function-calls/). Nice
  write about debugging but I like this advice:

  > Note: Using the || operator to add a log statement to a function prop is a great way to get around adding curly brackets.

- [react-window-communication-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-window-communication-hook). NPM
  package for communication between iframe or browser tabs/windows.

- [Tech choices I Regret at Spectrum](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tech-choice-regrets-at-spectrum). It is
  nice to see what I can learn from others and how decisions of architecture can impact product that you
  are building.

- [CSS Viewport Units](https://ishadeed.com/article/viewport-units/). Really interesting article about viewport
  units and why you may need them.

# Other

- [Identifying properties and streets in government data](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/04/02/identifying-properties-and-streets-in-government-data/).
  A nice blog post about identifying addresses in the UK.
