**Last week I was a mentor in two day Python workshop. The main goal of
this event was to show people who didn't have any prior experience with
programming that coding can be fun. Text below is note to myself that I
took from conducting such workshop.**

Split learning material
=======================

As there were 6 mentors we decided to split a work between us. I took
part with basic Python types and data structures.

I decided to split it into smaller pieces like variables, ints, floats,
strings, lists and dicts. After each subsection, there were tasks to do.
I didn't want it to be a huge pile of information and then some
exercises. Such workshops make me sleepy.

What I found out: split the material even more! Introduce 2 or 3
concepts and let people try it. For example, I presented lists - their
basic syntax and then I jump to taking data from such list. How can this
be improved? Split. First: basic syntax, one or two tasks to find
yourself comfortable and move on. Then the same with indexing.

Take your time - it's better to leave something than letting people
didn't know the basics.

Use simple examples
===================

For me as a person who codes for some time all examples where trivial
but in front of you sits people who didn't have any experience with
programming before! If you throw at them a lot of concepts in the same
time they will be confused.

For instance, functions and variables. We presented our mentees simple
function result that should be equal to a variable. We tell them to
write a body of this function. They started and started asking
questions.
Should this function return variable or something totally different?

For explaining it's better to use simple examples.

Tell group to ask any questions
===============================

In my culture, there is such feeling if you ask stupid question
everybody will be laughing.

To bypass it I decided to tell people:
ask every question that you want to ask! It's time for you to learn!

It helps a lot - as people are naturally afraid of looking stupid.
Reminding them that there is no such thing as a stupid question allows
to learn more.

Use fast and easy to setup environment
======================================

Everyone on the workshop uses Windows. Sometimes it can be a hustle to
teach not only Python but command line. To avoid it we used [Jupyter
notebook](http://jupyter.org/). It is easy to setup and fast. How to
install one on Windows? We decided to use
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) as it already has jupyter
installed. After installation, we didn't have any complaints about dev
environment which is awesome!

It is okay to be frustrated
===========================

Sometimes I had this thought: I prepare everything, I try with all my
power and still they didn't understand!

What I did - I acknowledge this feeling and told myself - what if it's
not a problem with them not understanding but with my process of
explaining?

Then I sit with every person who had a problem and started explaining it
one more time. Without feeling frustrated.

Help but no back-seat driving
=============================

This is something that I learned from [django girls coaching
tutorial](https://coach.djangogirls.org/tips/). If you there was a
problem I told a person when it can be found and that's all! Not
touching keyboard to fix the problem as they will lose interest.

Helping is very important but it's the best when people learn by doing
mistakes not by observing how you fix their mistakes by you.

Summary
=======

These are 6 lessons that I took while being a mentor. What are your
lessons? What do you find interesting and what not? Please write in
