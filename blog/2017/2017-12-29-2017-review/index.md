**Hello! In this blog post, I will write a little bit more what I was able to do in passing 2017. Let's get started!**

## What I did

In this year I was able to write 34 blog posts! Which is a great success. This year I started
playing a little bit more with JavaScript and thanks to that I made 3 pet projects:
[podcast-app](https://lit-basin-91592.herokuapp.com/) - made for learning React,
[all-roads-lead-to](https://krzysztofzuraw.github.io/all-roads-lead-to/) - to play with Google Maps,
[pomodoro-timer](https://krzysztofzuraw.github.io/pomodoro-timer/) - to play with pure JavaScript.
I started working on [photogram](https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/photogram) - yet this project
is in progress, I'm learning here React & Redux.

What I found out during this one year that I like working with fronts for web pages. I never
before had such job while creating something with a code as I've got this year. Based on that I decided
that I will continue my career with this direction and work next year also with JS, HTML & CSS.

## What I did not

This year was also a year of a few shortcomings: I figured out that I'm not the best developer out 
here - I got a lesson about being humble. I also didn't manage to keep my promises - lessons learned -
do not promise things that you can't deliver. I learn how not to handle large tasks and develop large
features. How I can be distracted. How it is easy to waste a whole day of work.

## Summary

This year was good - I failed a lot but I learned a lot. Into the next year!
Take care and happy new year!
