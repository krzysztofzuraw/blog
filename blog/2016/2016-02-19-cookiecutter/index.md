**Have you ever wanted to automate all these boring things that you have
to do while setting up new django project? Like writing proper settings,
setting up whole folder structure, adding docs, readmes, setup.py etc?
There is app that can do these mundane actions for you:** [Cookiecutter
Django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django).

Q: What you get after reading this post?

A: Basic understanding how you can automate boring tasks and get
exciting ones done!

Let's start with
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter). What exactly is
it? It's CLI tool for automatically generating projects from given
template. What do I mean by that?

Suppose that when you make new python project you want certain things to
be setup the same way every time. For instance: `setup.py` or docs
folders. Thanks to cookiecutter it's possible to automate these things
so every time you make the new project the boring stuff is already made
for you.

Django Cookiecutter is made especially for django applications. Based on
GitHub
[README](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django/blob/master/README.rst)
it provides:

> -   For Django 1.9
> -   Renders Django projects with 100% test coverage
> -   Twitter Bootstrap v4.0.0 - alpha
> -   End-to-end via Hitch
> -   AngularJS
> -   12-Factor based settings via django-environ
> -   Optimized development and production settings
> -   Registration via django-allauth
> -   Comes with custom user model ready to go.
> -   Grunt build for compass and livereload
> -   Basic e-mail configurations for sending emails via Mailgun
> -   Media storage using Amazon S3
> -   Docker support using docker-compose for development and production
> -   Procfile for deploying to Heroku

And some additional features:

> -   Serve static files from Amazon S3 or Whitenoise
> -   Configuration for Celery
> -   Integration with MailHog for local email testing
> -   Integration with Sentry for error logging
> -   Integration with NewRelic for performance monitoring
> -   Integration with Opbeat for performance monitoring

So it can make a huge improvement in initial project configuration.
Let's try this out!

After installation via pip by:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

Then after typing:

```bash
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django.git
```

And answering all these questions:

```bash
project_name [project_name]: blog_cookiecutter
repo_name [blog_cookiecutter]: blog-cookiecutter
author_name [Your Name]: Krzysztof Żuraw
email [Your email]: kz@example.com
description [A short description of the project.]: This is example of cookiecutter django usage
domain_name [example.com]: example.com
version [0.1.0]: 0.0.1
timezone [UTC]: UTC
now [2016/01/29]: 2016/02/18
year [2016]:
use_whitenoise [y]: n
use_celery [n]: y
use_mailhog [n]: n
use_sentry [n]: y
use_newrelic [n]: n
use_opbeat [n]: n

use_python2 [n]: n
Select open_source_license:
1 - MIT
2 - BSD
3 - Not open source
Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]: 1
```

You got the simple django application with celery, sentry, tests, grunt,
less and docker.

Folder structure looks as follows:

```bash
$ tree . -a -L 3

```

So as this application follows the [12-Factor](http://12factor.net/)
application guidelines most of django settings variables are set in an
environment so it's good to run this in docker.

To install docker on ubuntu type:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
$ sudo sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
```

Now it's time to add entry in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list` for
Ubuntu 14.04

``` {.sourceCode .text}
deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main
```

And run:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r)
$ sudo apt-get install docker-engine
```

Then verify if everything is installed:

```bash
$ sudo service docker start 
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

Now you have Docker! But to be able to use docker in cookiecutter-django
project there is need for installing additional package called
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). It allows to run
multiple docker containers.

Installation is simple:

```bash
$ sudo pip install docker-compose
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.6.0, build d99cad6
```

So it's time to fire up the installation:

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f dev.yml build
$ sudo docker-compose -f dev.yml up -d
```

`-f` flag means that we specify which yml file is taken for
configuration (by default it is `docker-compose.yml`) and `-d` flag in
the second command is for detached mode.

Now it's time to run basic django commands to migrate data to database
and to create superuser:

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f dev.yml run django python manage.py makemigrations
$ sudo docker-compose -f dev.yml run django python manage.py migrate
$ sudo docker-compose -f dev.yml run django python manage.py createsuperuser
```

And that's it! You got the working project made in few minutes. If you
found this post helpful please share it with your friends.
