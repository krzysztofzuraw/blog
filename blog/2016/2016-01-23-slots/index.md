**Hello everyone in new layout of blog. Today I will write more about
python `__slots__`.**

What exactly `__slots__` do? Imagine that you have a two python classes-
one with `__slots__` and other without:

```python
class Slots(object):
    __slots__ = ['arg1', 'arg2']

    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        self.arg1 = arg1
        self.arg2 = arg2

class NoSlots(object):
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        self.arg1 = arg1
        self.arg2 = arg2
```

Then instantiate them:

```python
>>> slots = Slots(arg1='first', arg2='second')
>>> no_slots = NoSlots(arg1='third', arg3='fourth')
```

At first there is no much difference between `slots` and `no_slots`
instances, but when we use `dir()`:

```python
>>> len(dir(slots))
26
>>> len(dir(no_slots))
27
```

So what is different? The answer is slots got `__slots__` and no\_slots:
`__dict__` and `__weakref__`. The implication of this is as follows:

```python
>>> slots.arg3 = 'fifth'
AttributeError: 'Slots' object has no attribute 'arg3'
>>> no_slots.arg3 = 'sixth'
>>> no_slots.arg3
'sixth'
```

Thanks to not having `__dict__`. Slots class is a bit faster, but it's
impossible to add attribute that is not in `__slots__`. Moreover there
is no `__weakref__` which means that it is not possible to cache this
object.
