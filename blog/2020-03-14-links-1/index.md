This is the first of my series about things that I found on the internet this week.

# Coding

- [When to useMemo and useCallback](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback/). This is old
  piece by Kent but I've got it in his weekly newsletter. Reading through examples requires some work
  but I've got this phrase: _Do not bother with optimization unnecessary_. To be honest (maybe) I'm
  lucky but I don't yet need to use `useMemo` or `useCallback`.

- I've read two pieces about HTML numeric inputs: [Why the GOV.UK Design System team changed the input type for numbers](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/) & [HTML attributes to improve your users' two factor authentication experience](https://www.twilio.com/blog/html-attributes-two-factor-authentication-autocomplete) and I've learned about `inputmode="numeric"`.
  I've to try it at work where we use `type="tel"` for better postal code experience on mobile.

- I learned that you can have CSS Grid inside your buttons too!. I've made a quick codepen [example](https://codepen.io/krzysztofzuraw/pen/xxGWMMz).

- Interesting piece on how to [work from home](https://nesslabs.com/working-from-home) & about [asynchronous communication](https://nesslabs.com/asynchronous-communication)
